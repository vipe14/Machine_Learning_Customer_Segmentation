# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project repository, where we tackle the challenge of clustering customers based on their shopping behavior. This project utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into segments, and it explores three different methods to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).

# Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to better understand and target their customers. By clustering customers with similar characteristics, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, optimize product recommendations, and improve overall customer satisfaction. In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to segment customers from the Mall Customer dataset.

# Methods to Determine K
**1. Elbow Method**
The Elbow Method involves running the K-means algorithm for a range of K values and plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against K. The "elbow point" in the graph represents the optimal K value, where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce the WCSS.

**2. Silhouette Score**
The Silhouette Score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. By calculating the Silhouette Score for various K values, we can identify the K that maximizes the overall similarity within clusters while minimizing similarity across clusters.

**3. Gap Statistics**
Gap Statistics compare the performance of the clustering algorithm to that of a random clustering. It involves generating random data points with the same distribution as the original data and calculating their WCSS. By comparing the original clustering's WCSS to the random clustering's WCSS, we can determine the optimal K.
